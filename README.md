## Control Modes

The DRV8874 Breakout Board supports two different control modes: PH/EN and PWM. The PH/EN mode uses the PH and EN pins to control the motor, while the PWM mode uses the IN1 and IN2 pins and PWM signals to control the motor.

To switch between the control modes, you need to change the position of the "PH/EN|PWM" jumper on the board. When the jumper is in the PH/EN position, the board is in PH/EN mode. When the jumper is in the PWM position, the board is in PWM mode.

* [PH/EN Control](./exampes/PHENControl/PHENControl.ino)
* [Current Sensing](./exampes/CurrentSensing/CurrentSensing.ino)
